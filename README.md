In this project we mimicked how Linkedin database stores posts data of a user and and wrote SQL statements that might look like their own SQL. To mimick the database, we used:
- The CREATE command to create a table to store the postdata.
- The INSERT command to add a few example rows in the table.
- The UPDATE command to emulate what happens when you edit data in the app.
- The DELETE command to emulate what happens when you delete data in the app.
